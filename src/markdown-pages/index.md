ðŸ‘‹! My name is Stas. Iâ€™m a software developer based in Brest, Belarus. Doing mostly web but interested in many aspects of software development.
Constantly trying to increase the maintainability of the code by decreasing its complexity (hopefully it works out)
and probably have good enough ability to research. At the moment I'm trying to make the fashion industry more automated. Hit me up if you have any questions!
